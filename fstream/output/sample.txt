william shakespare is very good phillospher. But i don't like philosophy i dont think it is mandatory i will tototally depend on philosophy. It's full of wastage of time. Why? Because it's my choice i decide it. Agh..... i am still think everything will be good but now it never happens but why?I am always frustrated due to high speed which is unable to coverup instantly and they behave like we knew everything then some people come which was ultr-legend their showoff never ends. I don't know what to do.some time i think it will end-up like a day.If you have an idea then we will work on it. I hate it . The place which was palace think by me but end up as a hell.After it just like a worst nightmarewhat would you think? A place where you enjoy or a place where person think you know everything. Always said "I want to teach concept". But They always makes question like i already done phd in it.
